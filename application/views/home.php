    <p>Back-end engineer focusing on supporting both the manufacturing team and the core 
        customer experience logic. I created and modified systems to manage inventory,

    <p>Some major projects I played a large role in include a designing and implementing 
        a statistical algorithmic system to improve customer data (working with several 
        manufacturing centres), significant framework update and code refactoring project 
        that removed tens of thousands of lines of code, and designing and implementing

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Since entering High school, I have competed in many different programming 
        competitions. Because of them, I developed my problem solving skills, ability 
        to work under pressure, and experience with implanting theoretical ideas. I 
        also gained significant familiarity with numerous algorithms and data structures 
        through studying for these contests in fields like machine learning, compression, 
        and graph theory, as well as the ability to design efficient algorithms for 
        problems that I have never seen before.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Model United Nations is a political simulation conference in which students act 
        as delegates to the UN and debate and attempt to solve world issues. I designed, 
        updated, and managed the Vancouver Model United Nations (VMUN) internet presence 
        that is still being used today by thousands of people today. To do this, I used 
        various front and back end technologies like HTML, CSS, WordPress, PHP, and MySQL 
        to create the website, email accounts, registration system, and server.</p>
